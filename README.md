### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I graduated from George Mason University in 2022 with a degree in Data Science.  I've recently started learning some more about web development and computer science.
Right now I am working on Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science (CS50) course and The Odin Project.I'm going to be sharing my coding assignments and projects here.
